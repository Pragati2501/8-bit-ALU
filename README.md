# 8-bit-ALU
ALU or arithmetic logic unit is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers
* In this verilog code, ALU can perform 8 kinds of operations viz., add, subtract, shift left, shift right, or, and , xor and comparator. The operations can be performed on two 8 bit binary numbers. Opcodes are specified for eac operation.

## Toolchain
* Xilinx ISE for synthesis
* Isim for simulation
